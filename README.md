# naivebayes-spam-classifier-scratch
This project implements a spam email classifier using a probabilistic Naive Bayes model programmed from scratch in a Jupyter Notebook. The solution leverages Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) for training, without relying on machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn for model training. The project features two main functionalities: a code block that allows users to input a custom email (including subject and content), preprocess it, and output a spam/ham prediction; and a code block that reads a CSV file structured like "val.csv" (with email title, content, and label) and evaluates the modelâ€™s prediction performance. Only basic libraries for non-training tasks (e.g., pandas, numpy) are used, ensuring the core statistical modeling is implemented manually.
